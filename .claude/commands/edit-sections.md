Read the file `f:\project\rss\sections.yaml` to see the current dashboard section definitions.

Show the user a summary table of all sections: name, icon, color, keyword count, visible/hidden.

Ask the user what they'd like to change. Common actions:
- Add a new section (ask for name, icon emoji, color, and keywords)
- Remove an existing section
- Change a section's properties (icon, color, keywords, visibility)
- Reorder sections

After the user tells you what to change, edit `f:\project\rss\sections.yaml` directly.

Tell the user to refresh the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see the changes.
